TV Series File Renamer
__________________________________________________________________________________________

This is a quick and simple program to rename TV Series files.
When you acquire an episode of a certain show, it may be called something like
"Family.Guy.720p.xvid.e1s02-IMMERSE", and it's rather ugly.

This program changes that to something more elegant, in this 
"Family Guy - S02E01 - Name of the Episode".

WARNING: The program will not work on all TV Shows (such as BBC's "Life" or "Doctor Who").

Feel free to comment on every flaw there is, I'd gladly take all the advice I can get.
