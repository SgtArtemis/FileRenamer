TV Series File Renamer
__________________________________________________________________________________________

This is a quick and simple program to rename TV Series files.
When you acquire an episode of a certain show, it may be called something like
"Family.Guy.720p.xvid.e1s02-IMMERSE", and it's rather ugly.

This program changes that to something more elegant, in this 
"Family Guy - S02E01 - Name of the Episode".

| NOTE:
| The program will only work if:
|
| You organize your TV Series with folders and subfolders. 
| For example G:\Media\Shows\Family Guy\Season 2\
| 
| If you dump all of the episodes into one folder, it will not work.
|
| It also assumes that the episodes start with the first episode of the season, and that they are in order.
| 
| The folder containing the episodes of a certain TV Series has at least one folder in it. Basically, even if the show only has one season, there is still a folder called "Season 1".
