TV Series File Renamer

This is a quick and simple program to rename TV Series files.
When you acquire an episode of a certain show, it may be called something like
"Family.Guy.720p.xvid.e1s02-IMMERSE", and it's rather ugly.

This program changes that to something more elegant, such as "Family Guy - S02E01 - Name of the Episode".

NOTE: 	The program will only work if:
	You organize your TV Series with folders and subfolders. For example G:\Media\Shows\Family Guy\Season 2\
	If you dump all of the episodes into one folder, it will not work.
	It also assumes that the episodes start with the first episode of the season, and that they are in order.
